# SettlersOfCatan
This repo aims to re-create the board game Settlers of Catan as an online game. The game is written as a Java application and the game itself is a multiplayer turnbased game. The communication will be handled through TCP in a server-client structure, where the host of the game becomes the server, and everyone else, including the host will become clients.

This poject is no longer being devloped, since the author lost insterest, and instead started developing a realtime 2D Android Game.
